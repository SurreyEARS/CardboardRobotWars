# Cardboard Robot Wars

Similar to the competitionn created by [Columbia Gadget Works](http://www.columbiagadgetworks.org/wiki/index.php/Combat_Robots), this competition involves putting robots made out of cardboard head to head to find a victor.

## Stuff to do
* Design a robot on a board to act as a starter kit for contestants.
  * The aim is to make this able to be programmed using the Arduino IDE and to combine either an Arduino or ESP with a motor shield onto a single board.
  * Will need to spec motors and other bits to act as a complete starter set
* Create starter code that allows the robot on a board to do basic things like communicate with a controller and move some motors
* Design a competition arena (and create a cool name for it)
* Create a set of competition and build rules
